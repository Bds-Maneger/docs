# Why it was done in electron

to think that javascript is universal, and to think that it is everywhere, not just on the web like Youtube.com, google.com, Facebook.com, etc ... But writing an entire app in javascript is almost impossible, for we have several other languages ​​around Electron.

Bds Manger itself was embedded in javascript and NodeJS so that it works to a large extent to be multiplatform between Linux and Windows (I would like those who were also compatible with MacOS plus darwin does not have support for Minecraft Bedrock Server). But the heart of Maneger itself is in its API, which can be used to a large extent in [any project¹](), but we don't want to see many errors, we have a form so simple that just use a repository as a base, and modify it accordingly need, and put in a repository for publishing.
