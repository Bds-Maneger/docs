# What are pegs for

Pages in a simple way it is just a theme for Bds Maneger in which you can include things that do not exist in the main theme.

As a whole you can create a theme for you to share, just create a repository [with this link](https://github.com/Bds-Maneger/Pages_template/generate) and modify as needed.

More information visit [Creating Pages for Bds Menege](pages_new_pages.html)
